# By default, "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/aerial-sdk-version" includes "25-3-cubb"
# During packaging, this string will be replaced with a specific version.
# Below cmake code we will read it and populate AERIAL_SDK_VERSION
# The value of AERIAL_SDK_VERSION will be compared against distributed YAML files with
# a released version. This way we make sure that both the software built/running and the
# YAML files came out from the same distribution.
# If users mix old YAMLs (for example) cuphydriver and similar executables will bail out saying that
# the tags that the SW is compiled with, and the YAML files' version attribute - these are having a
# mismatch.
# AERIAL_SDK_VERSION is passed via compile time with -DAERIAL_SDK_VERSION="..." and is used during
# runtime to check the YAML version attribute.
