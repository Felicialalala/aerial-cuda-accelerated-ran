#This file specifies the logical cores for each L1 Aerial component.  These are only logical cores - mapping to
#  physical cores performed by assign_physical_cores.py
#
# Each core specification is represented as <logical core>.<logical HT sibling>.<numa>
#  Both logical HT sibling and numa are optional (i.e. for nonHT case on numa 0, only logical core needs to be specified)
#
# Example 1 (non-HT on numa 0) - the following would allocate threads 1 and 2 to the same physical core,
#   while thread 3 and 4 would recieve their own cores (Total Physical Cores = 3)
# thread1: 0
# thread2: 0
# thread3: 1
# thread4: 2
#
# Example 2 (HT on numa 0) - the following would allocate threads 1 and 2 on HT siblings (same physical core),
#   while thread 3 and 4 would recieve their own cores (Total Physical Cores = 3)
# thread1: 0.0
# thread2: 0.1
# thread3: 1.0
# thread4: 2.0
#
# Example 2 (HT on numas 0 and 1) - the following would allocate threads 1 and 2 on HT siblings (same physical core, numa 0),
#   while thread 3 and 4 are on HT siblings for numa 1 (Total Physical Cores = 2)
# thread1: 0.0.0
# thread2: 0.1.0
# thread3: 0.0.1
# thread4: 0.1.1
#
# You can also set core value to -1 to indicate disabling of thread
#   (available only for threads that contain that feature, noted below)
