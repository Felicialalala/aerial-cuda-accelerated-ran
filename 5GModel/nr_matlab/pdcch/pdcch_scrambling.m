function b = pdcch_scrambling(e,E,rnti,N_id)

%function performs pdcch scrambling

%inputs:
% e    --> rate matched bits. Dim: E x 1
% E    --> number of transmit bits
% rnti --> users rnti number
% N_id --> physical cell id

%outputs:
% b    --> scrambled bits. Dim: E x 1

%START

%Step 1: compute seed
c_init = mod(rnti*2^16 + N_id,2^31);

%Step 2: compute Gold sequence
c = build_Gold_sequence(c_init,E);

%Step 3: scramble
b = xor(c,e);
