# cuPHY Driver

The cuPHY driver is responsible for orchestrating the work on the GPU and the FH by using cuPHY and FH libraries. It processes L2 slot commands generated by L2 adapter to launch tasks and sends cuPHY outputs (e.g. CRC indication, UCI indication, measurement reports, etc.) back to L2. It uses L2 adapter FAPI message handler library to communicate with L2.

cuPHY driver configures and initiates DL and UL cuPHY tasks, which in turn launch CUDA kernels on the GPU. These processes are managed at the slot level. The cuPHY driver also controls CUDA kernels responsible for transmission and reception of user plane (u-plane) packets to and from the NIC interface. The communication tasks launched by the driver takes care of re-ordering and decompression for UL packets and compression of DL packets. The DL packets are transmitted by GPU initiated communication after the compression.

cuPHY driver interacts with the FH interface using ORAN compliant FH library to coordinate transmission of FH control plane (c-plane) packets. The transmission of c-plane packets are done via DPDK library calls (CPU initiated communication). The u-plane packets are communicated through transmit and receive queues created by the cuphycontroller.
