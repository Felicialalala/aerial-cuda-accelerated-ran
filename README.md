# NVIDIA Aerial™ CUDA-Accelerated RAN

## Overview
NVIDIA Aerial™ CUDA-Accelerated RAN is a part of [NVIDIA AI Aerial™](https://developer.nvidia.com/industries/telecommunications/ai-aerial), a portfolio of accelerated computing platforms, software and tools to build, train, simulate, and deploy AI-native wireless networks.

Documentation for AI Aerial™ can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/aerial/index.html).

The following AI Aerial™ software is available as open source:
- NVIDIA Aerial™ CUDA-Accelerated RAN (this repository)
- [NVIDIA Aerial™ Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aerial-framework)

Updates on new software releases, NVIDIA 6G events and technical training for AI Aerial™ are available via the [NVIDIA 6G Developer Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/6g-program).

The **Aerial CUDA-Accelerated RAN** SDK includes:

- **GPU-Accelerated 5G PHY (cuPHY)**: CUDA-based physical layer processing for 5G NR including channel coding (LDPC, Polar), modulation/demodulation, MIMO processing, and channel estimation
- **GPU-Accelerated MAC Scheduler (cuMAC)**: High-performance L2 scheduler acceleration for resource allocation and scheduling
- **Python API (pyAerial)**: Python bindings for AI/ML research and integration with frameworks like TensorFlow and Sionna
- **5G Reference Models (5GModel)**: MATLAB-based 5G waveform generation and test vector creation based on 3GPP specifications
- **Containerized Environment**: Docker-based development and deployment with pre-built containers

## Getting Started

### Using Pre-Built Container (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/aerial-cuda-accelerated-ran.git --recurse-submodules
cd aerial-cuda-accelerated-ran

# Enable git LFS (if needed for large files)
git lfs install
git lfs pull

# Pull the Aerial container from NGC
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/aerial/aerial-cuda-accelerated-ran:25-3-cubb

# Start interactive development container
./cuPHY-CP/container/run_aerial.sh

# Inside container: Build SDK
./testBenches/phase4_test_scripts/build_aerial_sdk.sh
```

- Container versions available at [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/aerial/containers/aerial-cuda-accelerated-ran)
