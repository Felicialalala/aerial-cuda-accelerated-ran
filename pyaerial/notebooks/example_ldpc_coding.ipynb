    "# Using pyAerial for LDPC encoding-decoding chain\n",
    "This example shows how to use the pyAerial Python bindings to run 5G NR LDPC encoding, rate matching and decoding. Information bits, i.e. a transport block, get segmented into code blocks, LDPC encoded and rate matched onto the available time-frequency resources (resource elements), all following TS 38.212 precisely. The bits are then transmitted over an AWGN channel using QPSK modulation. At the receiver side, log likelihood ratios are extracted from the received symbols, (de)rate matching is performed and LDPC decoder is run to get the transmitted information bits. Finally, the code blocks are concatenated back into a received transport block.\n",
    "\n",
    "pyAerial utilizes the cuPHY library underneath for all components. In this example however, CRCs are just random blocks of bits in this example as we can compare the transmitted and received bits directly to compute block error rates.\n",
    "\n",
